# albion-craft-ui

Provide a graphical user interface for browsing item recipes and profitability.

This is achieved by scraping different textual data sources for building the item catalog, then enriching the data using public HTTP APIs.

The enriched data is used for building the user interface.

## Technical details

The project is divided into 3 components:
* `ui` - for displaying recipes and profitability
* `server` - for accessing item metadata
* `scripts` - for retrieving and translating raw data

### Available scripts

* `python parse.py`
    * Prerequisites:
        * `items.json` - download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/broderickhyman/ao-bin-dumps/master/items.json
        * `i18n.json` - download and rename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/broderickhyman/ao-bin-dumps/master/formatted/items.json
    * Outputs:
        * `items.csv` - CSV file containing item ID, tier, enchantment and other metadata
